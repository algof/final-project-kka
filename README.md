# Final Project Artificial Intelligence Concept
My group's final project for the Artificial Intelligence Concept Course. My friend Reynandriel and I created an artificial intelligence product, a game bot for a game like connect four.

We made a new arrangement by creating a dynamic grid area and different winning rules. We used the min-max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to trim uninteresting parts in the state search tree.
